                         Professor. Dumbledore, sir. Professor 
                         McGonagall.

                         No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep as 
                         we were flying over Bristol. Try not 
                         to wake him. There you go.

                         Sorry 'bout that.

                         Dry up Dursley you great prune. Well, 
                         I haven't seen you since you was a baby 
                         Harry. But you're a bit more along then 
                         I would have expected; particularly 
                         around the middle.

                         Well of course you are! Got something 
                         for you. Afraid I might have sat on 
                         it at some point but I imagine it'll 
                         taste fine just the same. Baked it myself, 
                         words and all.

                         It's not everyday your young man turns 
                         11 now it is?

                         Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds 
                         at Hogwarts. Of course you know all 
                         about Hogwarts

                         No? Blimey Harry didn't you ever wonder 
                         didn't you ever wonder how your mum 
                         and dad learned it all?

                         You're a wizard Harry.

                         A wizard. And a thumpin' good one I'd 
                         wager once you've trained up a bit.

                         Well, "Just Harry" did you ever make 
                         anything happen? Anything you couldn't 
                         explain, when you were angry or scared? 
                         Um Hum.

                         A car crash? A car crash killed Lily 
                         and James Potter?

                         It's an outrage. It's a scandal.

                         Oh and I suppose a great Muggle like 
                         yourself is gonna stop him.

                         Non- magic folk. This boy's had his 
                         name down since he were born. He's going 
                         to the finest school of witchcraft and 
                         wizardry in the world. And he'll be 
                         under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts 
                         has ever seen, Albus Dumbledore...

                         Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front 
                         of me... I'd appreciate it if you didn't 
                         tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. 
                         Strictly speaking I'm not supposed to 
                         do magic.

                         We're a bit behind schedule. Best be 
                         off. Unless you'd rather stay, of course. 

                         If you know where to go.

                         No thanks Tom, I'm on official Hogwarts 
                         business. Just helping young Harry buy 
                         his school business.

                         hello, professor I didn't see you there. 
                         Harry Professor Quirrell will be your 
                         defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

                         Yes, well must be going now. Lots to 
                         buy.

                         See, Harry? You're famous.

                         I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person 
                         to tell you that, Harry. Welcome Harry, 
                         to Diagon Alley. That's where you get 
                         your quills and ink. Over there, all 
                         your bits and bobs for doing wizardry.

                         Well there's your money Harry! Gringotts, 
                         the wizard bank! Ain't no safer place, 
                         not one! 'Cept perhaps Hogwarts.

                         They're goblins Harry. Clever as they 
                         come the goblins, but not the most friendly 
                         of beasts. Best stay close. Mr. Harry 
                         Potter wishes to make a withdrawal

                         Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. 
                         Ha! There's the little devil. Oh, and 
                         there's something else as well. Professor 
                         Dumbledore gave me this. It's about 
                         You- Know- What in vault you know which.

                         Didn't think your mum and dad would 
                         leave you with nothing now did you?

                         Can't tell you Harry. Hogwarts business. 
                         Very secret.

                         Best not to mention this to anyone Harry.

                         A wand? Well, you want Ollivander's. 
                         There ain't no place better. Why don't 
                         you run along and wait. I got one more 
                         thing to do. Won't be long.

                         Harry! Harry! Happy Birthday!

                         You all right Harry? You seem very quiet.

                         First and understand this Harry because 
                         it's very important. Not all wizards 
                         are good. Some of them go bad. A few 
                         years ago one of them went as bad as 
                         you can go. His name was V--. His name 
                         was V--.

                         Naw I can't spell it. All right, Voldemort.

                         Shh. It was dark times Harry, dark times. 
                         Voldemort started to gather some followers. 
                         Brought them over to the Dark Side. 
                         Anyone who stood up to him ended up 
                         dead. Your parents fought against him. 
                         Nobody lived once he decided to kill 
                         them. Nobody, not one. Except you.

                         Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your 
                         forehead Harry. A mark from that only 
                         comes from being touched by a curse, 
                         an evil curse at that.

                         Well some say he died. Codswallop in 
                         my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out 
                         there still too tired to carry on. But 
                         one thing's absolutely certain. Something 
                         about you stumped him that night. That's 
                         why you're famous. That's why everybody 
                         knows your name. You're the boy who 
                         lived.

                         Well some say he died. Codswallop in 
                         my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out 
                         there still too tired to carry on. But 
                         one thing's absolutely certain. Something 
                         about you stumped him that night. That's 
                         why you're famous. That's why everybody 
                         knows your name. You're the boy who 
                         lived.

                         What are you looking at? Blimey is that 
                         time? Sorry Harry, but I'm gonna have 
                         to leave you. Dumbledore would be wanting 
                         his... Well, he'd be wanting to see 
                         me. Now, your train leaves in 10 minutes. 
                         Here's your ticket. Stick to it Harry, 
                         that's very important. Stick to you 
                         ticket.

                         Right then. First years this way, please! 
                         First years, don't be shy. Come on now, 
                         hurry up! Hello Harry!

                         Right, then. This way to the boats. 
                         Come on now, follow me.

                         Well done!

                         What's going on with Harry's broomstick?

                         Go, go, go, go! Looks like he's gonna 
                         be sick!

                         Yes!

                         Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse 
                         on Harry's broom?

                         Who told you about Fluffy?

                         Well, of course, he's got a name! He's 
                         mine! I brought him off an Irish feller 
                         I met down at the pub last year. Then 
                         I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the---

                         I shouldn't have said that. No more 
                         questions! Don't ask anymore question! 
                         That's top- secret that is.

                         Codswallop! Professor Snape is a Hogwarts 
                         teacher!

                         Now listen to me, all three of you, 
                         you're meddling in things that ought 
                         not to be meddled in. It's dangerous! 
                         What that dog is guarding is strictly 
                         between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas 
                         Flamel.

                         I shouldn't have said that. I should 
                         not have said that.

                         Oh, hello. I don't wish to be rude, 
                         but I'm in no fit state to entertain 
                         today.

                         Snape? Blimey, you're still on about 
                         him, are you?

                         Snape is one of the teachers protecting 
                         the Stone! He's not about to steal it.

                         You heard. Right, now, come on, I'm 
                         a bit preoccupied today.

                         Right. Waste of bloody time if you ask 
                         me. Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. 
                         Ain't a soul knows how, except me and 
                         Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you 
                         that. I should not have told you that.

                         Oh, That? It's a...it's um...

                         I won it! Off a stranger I met at the 
                         pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid of 
                         it, as a matter of fact.

                         Isn't he beautiful? Oh bless him look, 
                         he knows his mummy! Hello Norbert!

                         Well he's gotta have a name don't he? 
                         Don't you Norbert? Te de de de de! Oh! 
                         Woah! He'll have to be trained up a 
                         bit of course. Who's that?

                         Oh, dear.

                         Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him 
                         off to Romania to live in a colony.

                         Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? 
                         What if the other dragons are mean to 
                         him? He's only a baby after all.

                         Right, let's go.

                         What we're here for. See that? That's 
                         unicorn blood, that is. I found one 
                         dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's 
                         been hurt bad by something. So, it's 
                         our job to go and find the poor beast. 
                         Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.

                         And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

                         Fine. Just so you know he's bloody coward.

                         Hello there Firenze. See you've met 
                         our young Mr. Potter. All right there 
                         Harry?

                         I dunno. I never saw his face. He kept 
                         his hood up.

                         Well, he wanted to know what sort of 
                         creatures I looked after. And I told 
                         him, after Fluffy a dragon's gonna be 
                         no problem.

                         Well of course he was interested in 
                         Fluffy! How often do you come across 
                         three headed dogs do you come across 
                         even if you're in the trade? But I told 
                         him, I said, I said, "The trick with 
                         any beast is to know how to calm him." 
                         Take Fluffy for example, just play him 
                         a bit of music and he falls straight 
                         asleep. I shouldn't have told you that. 
                         Where are you going? Where are you---?

                         Yes!

                         Come on now. Hurry up, you'll be late! 
                         Train's leaving. Go on. Come on, hurry 
                         up.

                         Thought you were leaving without saying 
                         good-bye did you? This is for you.

                         Oh. Go on. On with you. On with you 
                         now. On with you. Oh, listen, Harry. 
                         If that dolt of a cousin of yours Dudley 
                         gives you any grief you can always um... 
                         threaten him, with a nice pair of ears
