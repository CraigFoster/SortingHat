                         It's true then, what they're saying 
                         on the train. Harry Potter has come 
                         to Hogwarts.

                         This is Crabbe and Goyle. And I'm Malfoy. 
                         Draco Malfoy. Think my name's funny 
                         do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair 
                         and a hand-me-down robe? You must be 
                         a Weasley. You'll soon find out that 
                         some wizarding families are better than 
                         others, Potter. You don't want to making 
                         friends with the wrong sort. I can help 
                         you there.

                         Up.

                         Did you see his face? If the fat lump 
                         had given this a squeeze he would remember 
                         to fall on his fat arse.

                         No, I think I'll leave it somewhere 
                         for Longbottom to find. How about on 
                         the roof? What's the matter Potter? 
                         Bit beyond you reach?

                         Is that so? Have it your way, then!

                         Excuse me professor. Perhaps I heard 
                         you wrong. I thought you said the four 
                         of us.

                         The Forest? I thought that was a joke. 
                         We can't go in there. Students aren't 
                         allowed. And there are... werewolves!

                         Okay, then I get Fang!

                         Wait till my father hears about this! 
                         This is servant stuff.

                         Scared Potter. Did you hear that?

                         Scared!

                         AH!

                         Nice one mate.
