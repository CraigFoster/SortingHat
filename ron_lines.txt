                         Excuse me, do you mind? Every where 
                         else is full.

                         I'm Ron by the way! Ron Weasley.

                         SO it's true! DO you really have the... 
                         the...

                         The scar?

                         Wicked!

                         No, thanks, I'm all set.

                         Woah!

                         They mean every flavor! There's chocolate, 
                         peppermint and also, spinach liver, 
                         and tripe. George sweared he got boogie 
                         flavored one once.

                         It's just a spell. But it's the cards 
                         you want. Each pack's got a famous witch 
                         or wizard. I got about 500 me self. 
                         Watch it! That's rotten luck. They've 
                         only got one good jump in them to begin 
                         with.

                         I've got about 6 of him.

                         Well you can't expect him to hang around 
                         all day, can you? This is Scabbers by 
                         the way. Pathetic isn't he?

                         Fred gave me a spell to turn him yellow. 
                         Want to see?

                         Ahem... Sunshine...

                         No.

                         Ahem. Sunshine Daisies Butter Mellow 
                         Turn this stupid fat rat yellow.

                         I'm Ron Weasley.

                         Woah!

                         Wicked!

                         Mental that one, I'm telling you.

                         There's no witch or wizard who went 
                         bad who wasn't in Slytherin.

                         Harry what is it?

                         Ah!

                         I know you. You're Nearly Headless Nick.

                         Ah!

                         Whew! We made it! Can you imagine the 
                         look on McGonagall's face if we were 
                         late? That was bloody brilliant!

                         Turn it to rum. Actually he managed 
                         to make weak tea yesterday, before--- 
                         Ah, mail's here.

                         Up. Up!

                         UP! Ow! Shut up Harry.

                         Seeker? But first years never make the 
                         house teams. You must be the youngest 
                         Quidditch player in...

                         Fred and George are on the team too. 
                         Beaters.

                         Oh go on Harry! Quidditch is great. 
                         Best game there is, and you'll be great 
                         too!

                         Woah! Harry, you never told me your 
                         father was a seeker too!

                         I'm telling you, it's spooky! She knows 
                         move about you than you do!

                         Before the staircase moves again. Does 
                         anybody feel like we shouldn't be here?

                         that's it we're done for!

                         Alohomora?

                         He thinks this door is locked.

                         What do they think they're doing? Keeping 
                         a thing like that locked up in a school?

                         I wasn't looking at its feet! I was 
                         a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or 
                         maybe you didn't notice... the three!

                         She needs to sort out her priorities.

                         Wingardium Leviosa!

                         You do it then if you're so clever. 
                         Go on, go on!

                         "It's Levi-o-sa not Leviosar." She's 
                         a nightmare honestly! It's no wonder 
                         she hasn't got any friends!

                         Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid. 
                         Probably people playing jokes. What?

                         I think the troll's left the dungeon!

                         Hey, pea brain!

                         Ugh!

                         What?

                         Wingardium Leviosa! Cool.

                         Troll boogies.

                         Well what it is-

                         Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

                         Let's open it.

                         It's not just a broomstick, Harry. It's 
                         a Nimbus 2000!

                         Jinxing the broom?! What do we do?

                         Come on Hermione!

                         Fluffy?

                         Queen to E-5.

                         That's wizard's chess. I see you've 
                         packed.

                         Change of plans. My parents have decided 
                         to go to Romania to visit my brother 
                         Charlie. He's studying dragons there.

                         We've looked a hundred times!

                         I think we've had a bad influence on 
                         her.

                         Harry wake up! Come on Harry! Wake up! 
                         Happy Christmas Harry!

                         Oh, my mum made it. Looks like you've 
                         got one too.

                         Yeah! There they are.

                         What is it?

                         Well let's see then! Put it on! Woah!

                         I know what that is! That's an Invisibility 
                         Cloak!

                         They're really rare. I wonder who gave 
                         it to you.

                         Why?

                         I only see us.

                         That's me! Only, I'm Head Boy. And I'm 
                         holding the Quidditch Cup. And bloody 
                         hell! I'm Quidditch captain too! I look 
                         good! Harry, do you think this mirror 
                         shows the future?

                         This is light?

                         The what?

                         Immortal!

                         I know what it means!

                         I know what that is! But Hagrid how 
                         did you get one?

                         That's not just a dragon! That's a Norwegian 
                         Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works 
                         with these in Romania.

                         It's crazy! And worse Malfoy knows.

                         It's bad.

                         Okay...

                         But if he comes back, you don't think 
                         he'll try to kill you, do you?

                         And to think, I've been worrying about 
                         my Potions final.

                         Speak for yourself. All right there 
                         Harry?

                         Perhaps you should see the nurse.

                         Trevor, sh, go you shouldn’t be here!

                         You’re a little scary sometimes, you 
                         know that. Brilliant, but scary.  

                         It’s for your own good you know.

                         Ugh! It’s got horrible breath.

                         What?

                         Ugh! Yuck! Ugh!

                         Woah! Lucky this plant thing’s here 
                         really! Woah!

                         Kill us faster? Oh now I can relax!

                         Oh now what are we going to do?

                         Ah! Harry! Harry!

                         Yeah. Lucky we didn’t panic!

                         Alohomora! Well, it was worth a try.

                         We’re looking for a big old fashioned 
                         one. Probably rusty like the handle.

                         Oh, go on Harry! If Snape can catch 
                         it on that old broomstick, you can! 
                         You’re the youngest Seeker in a century! 
                         This complicates things a bit!

                         Hurry up!

                         This is no graveyard, it’s a chessboard.

                         Its obvious isn’t it? We’ve got to play 
                         our way across the room. All right, 
                         Harry, you take the empty bishop’s square. 
                         Hermione you’ll be the queen-side castle. 
                         As for me, I’ll be a knight.

                         Well, white moves first, and then we 
                         play.

                         You there D-5. Yes Hermione I think 
                         this is gonna be exactly like wizard’s 
                         chess. Castle to E-4! Pawn to C-3!

                         You understand right Harry. Once I make 
                         my move the queen will take me. Then 
                         you’re free to check the king.

                         Do you wanna stop Snape from getting 
                         that Stone or not? Harry, it’s you that 
                         has to go on. I know it! Not me! Not 
                         Hermione! You! Knight to H-3. Check. 
                         Ah!

                         Alright. You?
