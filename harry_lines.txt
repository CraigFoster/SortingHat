                         Yes Aunt Petunia.

                         yes Uncle Vernon.

                         He's asleep.

                         Sorry about him he doesn't understand 
                         what it's like, lying there day after 
                         day watching people press their ugly 
                         faces in on you. Can you hear me? It's 
                         just I've never talked to a snake before. 
                         Do you... Do you talk to people often? 
                         You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it 
                         nice there? Did you miss your family? 
                         I see. That's me as well. I never knew 
                         my parents either.

                         Any time.

                         I swear, I don't know! One minute the 
                         glass was there then it was gone, it 
                         was like magic!

                         Hey give it back! It's mine!

                         Because there's no post on Sundays.

                         Get off! They're my letters! Let go 
                         of me!

                         Make a wish, Harry.

                         I am.

                         Thank you!

                         Excuse me, but who are you?

                         Sorry, no.

                         Learned what?

                         I'm a what?

                         No, you've made a mistake. I mean I 
                         can't be a wizard... I mean I'm Harry, 
                         Just Harry.

                         Dear Mr. Potter, we are pleased to inform 
                         you that you have been accepted at the 
                         Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

                         You knew? We knew all along and you 
                         never told me?

                         Blown up?! You told me my parents died 
                         in a car crash!

                         Muggle?

                         OK

                         All students must be equipped with a 
                         one standard size two pewter cauldron, 
                         and may bring, if they desire, either 
                         an owl, a cat, or a toad. Can we find 
                         all this in London?

                         Oh, nice to meet you,

                         Good bye.

                         But why am I famous Hagrid? All those 
                         people back there how is it they know 
                         who I am?

                         But Hagrid how am I to pay for all this? 
                         I haven't any money.

                         Hagrid what exactly are these things?

                         What's in there Hagrid?

                         I still need... a wand.

                         Hello? Hello?

                         Sorry but what's curious

                         And who owned that wand?

                         Woah!

                         He killed my parents didn't he? The 
                         one who gave me this. You know Hagrid. 
                         I know you do.

                         Well maybe if you wrote it down?

                         Voldemort?

                         Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

                         What happened to V--... To You-Know-Who?

                         Platform 9 ? But, Hagrid, there must 
                         be a mistake. This says Platform 9 ? 
                         There's no such thing. Is there?

                         Excuse me! Excuse me!

                         Excuse me sir. Can you tell me where 
                         I might find Platform 9 ?

                         Muggles?

                         Excuse me! Could you tell me how to...

                         Not at all.

                         I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

                         The what?

                         Oh!

                         We'll take the lot!

                         Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?

                         These aren't real frogs are they?

                         I've got Dumbledore!

                         Hey, he's gone!

                         Just a little bit.

                         Yeah!

                         Hi Hagrid!

                         I think I can tell the wrong sort for 
                         my self thanks.

                         Ah, right then. Hum... Right. Okay, 
                         Gryffindor!

                         Slytherin!

                         Ow!

                         Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine

                         ...where shall I put you? Let's see... 
                         I know! Hufflepuff!

                         Ha! Another Weasley! I know just what 
                         to do with you... Gryffindor!

                         Hmmm... Difficult, very difficult. Plenty 
                         of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. 
                         There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst 
                         to prove yourself. But where to put 
                         you...

                         Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

                         Not Slytherin eh? Are you sure? You 
                         could be great you know. It's all herein 
                         your head. And Slytherin will help you 
                         on the way to greatness, there's no 
                         doubt about that. No? (Harry whispering: 
                         Please, Please anything but Slytherin, 
                         anything but Slytherin.) Well if you're 
                         sure, better be... Gryffindor!

                         Wow!

                         Say Percy, who's that teacher talking 
                         to Professor Quirrell?

                         What's he teach?

                         We got lost.

                         I don't know, sir.

                         I don't know sir.

                         What's Seamus trying to do to that glass 
                         of water?

                         Can I burrow this? Thanks.

                         Hey Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. 
                         Listen: "Believed to be the work of 
                         Dark wizards or witches unknown, Gringotts 
                         goblins were acknowledging the breach 
                         insist nothing was taken. The vault 
                         in question number 713 had been emptied 
                         earlier that very same day." That's 
                         odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went 
                         to.

                         Good afternoon, class.

                         Good afternoon Amanda, good afternoon. 
                         Welcome to your first flying lesson. 
                         Well what are you waiting for? Everyone 
                         step up to the left side of their broomstick. 
                         Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right 
                         hand over the broom and say up.

                         Woah!

                         With feeling!

                         Now once you've got hold of your broom, 
                         I want you to mount it. Grip it tight. 
                         You don't wanna be sliding off the end. 
                         When I blow my whistle, I want each 
                         of you to kick off from the ground, 
                         hard. Keep your broom steady, hover 
                         for a moment, then lean forward slightly 
                         and touch back down. On my whistle. 
                         Three, two... Mr. Longbottom. Mr. Mr. 
                         Mr. Longbottom!

                         Neville!

                         Come back down this instant! Mr. Longbottom! 
                         Everyone out of the way!

                         Oh oh oh. Oh dear, it's a broken wrist. 
                         Poor boy. Come on now, up you get. Everyone 
                         is to keep their feet firmly on the 
                         ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to 
                         the hospital wing. Understand? If I 
                         see a single broom in the air the one 
                         riding it will find themselves out of 
                         Hogwarts before they can say "Quidditch".

                         Give it here Malfoy.

                         Give it here Malfoy or I'll knock you 
                         off your broom!

                         A century. According to McGonagall.

                         But I've never even played Quidditch! 
                         What if I make a fool of myself?

                         I didn't know.

                         Who doesn't? What's happening?

                         Let's go this way.

                         Let's go.

                         Run! Quick, let's hide through that 
                         door! It's locked!

                         And for good reason.

                         Guarding something?

                         I think so. What are those?

                         What was that?

                         I like this ball.

                         What do I do with it?

                         Woah!

                         I think we're going to need another 
                         feather over here professor.

                         I think she heard you.

                         Where's Hermione?

                         How could a troll get in?

                         Hermione! She doesn't know!

                         It's going into the girl's bathroom. 
                         Hermione move!

                         Woah!

                         Do something!

                         Anything! Hurry up!

                         No just knocked out.

                         Ugh.

                         I'm not hungry.

                         That explains the blood.

                         Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape 
                         let the troll in as diversion so he 
                         could get past that three headed dog. 
                         But, he got bit, that's why he's limping.

                         The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took 
                         something out of one of the vaults. 
                         Said it was Hogwarts business, very 
                         secret.

                         That's what the dog's guarding. That's 
                         what Snape wants.

                         But, I never get mail.

                         It's a broomstick.

                         But who--?

                         A little.

                         What happened?

                         Now, I want a nice clean game... from 
                         all of you.

                         Gryffindor wins!

                         Who knows? Why was he trying to get 
                         past that three-headed dog on Halloween?

                         Yes?

                         But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding 
                         Snape's trying to steal it!

                         Exactly.

                         Nicholas Flamel?

                         Nicholas Flamel. Who's Nicholas Flamel?

                         Knight to E-5.

                         Happy Christmas Ron! What are you wearing?

                         I've got presents?

                         "Your father left this in my possession 
                         before he died. It is time it was returned 
                         to you. Use it well."?

                         Some kind of cloak.

                         My body is gone!

                         I'm invisible?

                         There was no name. It just said, "Use 
                         it well."

                         Fiends. Flamel. Nicholas Flamel. Where 
                         are you?

                         Mum, Dad? Ron! You've really gotta see 
                         this! Ron! You've gotta see this! Ron! 
                         Come on, get out of bed!

                         There's something you've got to see! 
                         Now, come on! Come on! Come! Come look! 
                         It's my parents!

                         Look in properly. Go on, stand there. 
                         There. You see them don't you? That's---

                         How can it? Both my parents are dead.

                         So then, it shows us what we want... 
                         Whatever we want?

                         Hagrid!

                         We think Snape's trying to steal it.

                         Hagrid! We know he's after the Stone 
                         we just don't know why!

                         What?

                         Wait a minute! "One of the teachers"?

                         Hagrid, what exactly is that?

                         Norbert?

                         Malfoy.

                         Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told 
                         me so the first time I ever met him.

                         50!

                         Hagrid, what is that?

                         If I didn't know better Draco, I'd say 
                         you were scared.

                         Come on Fang!

                         What is it Fang?

                         But what was that thing you saved me 
                         from?

                         But who would choose such a life?

                         You mean to say that thing that killed 
                         the unicorn, that was drinking its blood, 
                         that was Voldemort?

                         The Sorcerer's Stone!

                         But he's weak. He's living off of unicorns. 
                         Don't you see? We had it wrong! Snape 
                         doesn't want the Stone for himself. 
                         He wants the Stone for Voldemort. With 
                         the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will become 
                         strong again. He, he'll come back.

                         I think if he had his chance he would 
                         have tried to kill me tonight.

                         My scar. It keeps burning.

                         Not like this.

                         I think it's a warning. It means danger's 
                         coming. Ah. Oh, Of Course.

                         Don't you think it's a bit odd that 
                         what Hagrid want more than anything 
                         is a dragon and a stranger turns up 
                         and just happens to have one? I mean, 
                         how many people wander around with dragon 
                         eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I 
                         see it before? Hagrid, who gave you 
                         that dragon egg? What did he look like?

                         This stranger though, you and he must 
                         have talked.

                         Did he seem interested in Fluffy?

                         We have to see professor Dumbledore 
                         immediately!

                         We have to see Professor Dumbledore 
                         immediately!

                         He’s gone! But this is important! This 
                         is about the Sorcerer’s Stone!

                         Someone’s going to try to steal it!

                         That was no stranger Hagrid met. It 
                         was Snape. Which means that he knows 
                         how to get past Fluffy.

                         We go down the trap door, tonight.

                         Trevor.

                         Now Neville listen. We were... we were---

                         Let’s go.

                         Sorry.

                         Wait a minute. He’s snoring. Snape’s 
                         already been here. He’s put a spell 
                         on the harp.

                         We have to move its paw.

                         Come on! Okay, push! I’ll go first. 
                         Don’t follow me until I give you a sign. 
                         If something bad happens get yourselves 
                         out! Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

                         Jump!

                         Hermione!

                         Hermione where are you?

                         Yeah, yeah I’m fine. (Ron Weasley: Help!)

                         Apparently not. (Ron Weasley: Help me!)

                         What? (Ron Weasley: Help!)

                         Ron, are you okay?

                         I don’t know Sounds like wings.

                         They’re not birds they’re keys. And 
                         I’ll bet one of then fits that door.

                         I don’t know. Strange.

                         There! I see it! The one with the broken 
                         wing!

                         It is too simple.

                         Catch the key!

                         Where are we? A graveyard?

                         There’s the door!

                         Wait a minute.

                         No. Ron no!

                         He is going to sacrifice himself!

                         Ron! No don’t move! Don’t forget we’re 
                         still playing! Checkmate! Take care 
                         of Ron then go to the owlery. Send a 
                         message to Dumbledore. Ron’s right. 
                         I have to go on.

                         Not as good as you.

                         You? No it can’t be; Snape he was he 
                         was the one---

                         But that day, during the Quidditch match, 
                         Snape tried to kill me.

                         Snape was trying to save me?

                         Then then you let the troll in!

                         I’m shaking hands with Dumbledore. I’ve 
                         won the House Cup.

                         Voldemort?

                         Never!

                         You liar!

                         Admirers?

                         Ron was here? Is he alright? What about 
                         Hermione?

                         Bu, what happened to the Stone?

                         But then Flamel, he'll die won't he?

                         How is it I got the Stone sir? One minute 
                         I was there staring in the mirror and 
                         then the next---

                         Does that mean with the Stone gone that 
                         is, that Voldemort can never come back?

                         What is it?

                         Alright there Ron?

                         Alright. Hermione?

                         One minute.

                         Thanks Hagrid.

                         But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do 
                         magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.

                         I'm not going home. Not really.
