                         has anyone seen a toad? A boy named 
                         Neville's has one.

                         Oh are you doing magic? Let's see then.

                         Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, 
                         it's not very good is it? Of course, 
                         I've only tried a few simple ones myself 
                         but they've all worked for me. For example: 
                         Oculus Reparo. That's better isn't it? 
                         Holy cricket! You're Harry Potter! I'm 
                         Hermione Granger. And you are...?

                         Pleasure. You two better change into 
                         your robes. I expect we'll be arriving 
                         soon. You've dirt on your nose by the 
                         way. Just there.

                         It's not real the ceiling. It's just 
                         bewitched to look like the night outside. 
                         I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.

                         Oh, no. OK relax.

                         "Nearly" headless? How can you be "nearly" 
                         headless?

                         I've read about those. When the smoke 
                         turns red it means you've forgotten 
                         something.

                         Up. Up! Up. Up!

                         Is he alright?

                         Harry! No way! You heard what Madame 
                         Hooch said. Besides you don't even know 
                         how to fly! What an idiot!

                         You won't make a fool of yourself. It's 
                         in your blood.

                         The staircases change remember?

                         We're not supposed to be here. This 
                         is the third floor. It's forbidden!

                         Flich's cat!

                         Oh! Move over! Alohomora! Get in!

                         Standard Book Of Spells- Chapter 7!

                         He thinks this door is locked.

                         It was locked.

                         AH!

                         You don't use your eyes do you? Didn't 
                         you see what it was standing on?

                         It was standing on a trap door. It wasn't 
                         there by accident. It's guarding something.

                         That's right. Now, if you two don't 
                         mind, I'm going to bed before either 
                         of you come up with another clever idea 
                         to get killed or worse... expelled.

                         No, stop stop stop! You're going to 
                         take someone's eye out! Besides, you're 
                         saying it wrong. It's Levi-o-sa, not 
                         Leviosar.

                         Wingardium Leviosa.

                         Help! Help!

                         Ah! Help!

                         "Swish & Flick!"

                         Is it dead?

                         It's my fault Professor Mc Gonagall

                         I went looking for the troll I've read 
                         about them and I though I could handle 
                         it. But I was wrong.  If Harry and Ron 
                         hadn’t come and found me... I’d probably 
                         be dead.

                         Ron's right Harry, you're going to need 
                         your strength today.

                         Blood?

                         But why would anyone go near that dog?

                         So you're saying- -

                         A bit early for mail isn't it?

                         It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!

                         Leave it to me!

                         Lacarnum Inflamarae.

                         That thing has a name?

                         Hogwarts teacher or not I know a spell 
                         when I see one! I've read all about 
                         them. You've got to keep eye contact 
                         and Snape wasn't blinking!

                         I don't know.

                         That's totally barbaric!

                         See you haven't.

                         Good. You can help Harry then. He's 
                         going to look in the library for information 
                         on Nicholas Flamel.

                         Not in the Restricted Section. Happy 
                         Christmas.

                         I had you looking in the wrong section! 
                         How could I be so stupid? I checked 
                         this out weeks ago for a bit of light 
                         reading!

                         Of course! Here it is! "Nicholas Flamel 
                         is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's 
                         Stone

                         Honestly don't you two read? "The Sorcerer's 
                         Stone is a legendary substance with 
                         astonishing powers. It will transform 
                         any metal into pure gold and produce 
                         the Elixir of Life which will make the 
                         drinker immortal."

                         It means you'll never die.

                         The only stone currently in existence 
                         belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the 
                         noted alchemist who last year celebrated 
                         his 665th birthday." That's what Fluffy's 
                         guarding on the third floor. That's 
                         what's under the trap door. The Sorcerer's 
                         Stone.

                         We know about the Sorcerer's Stone!

                         Of course! There are other things defending 
                         the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments?

                         Is that...a dragon?

                         I don't understand. Is that bad?

                         Well, that's good isn't it? He'll be 
                         with his own kind.

                         Harry!

                         You mean, that You- Know- Who is out 
                         there right now in the Forest?

                         Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one 
                         thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort 
                         is always feared? Dumbledore. As long 
                         as Dumbledore's around, Harry, you're 
                         safe. As long as Dumbledore's around 
                         you can't be touched.

                         I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were 
                         frightful, but I found they're rather 
                         enjoyable

                         It's happened before.

                         What is it?

                         And with Dumbledore gone---

                         We were... we were just---

                         Now what are we do?

                         Neville, I’m really really sorry about 
                         this. Petrificus totalus!

                         Sorry.

                         Ow! You stood on my foot!

                         Alohomora.

                         The harp, it stopped playing.

                         Stop moving, both of you! This is Devil’s 
                         Snare. You have to relax! If you don’t 
                         it’ll only kill you faster!

                         Just relax!

                         Do what I say! Trust me!

                         Are you okay?

                         He’s not relaxing is he? (Ron Weasley: 
                         Help!)

                         We’ve got to do something! (Ron Weasley: 
                         Help!)

                         I remember reading something in Herbology. 
                         (Ron Weasley: Help!) “Devil’s Snare 
                         Devil’s Snare it’s deadly fun; but will 
                         sulk in the sun.?That’s it! Devil’s 
                         Snare hates sunlight! Lumus Solem!

                         What is that?

                         Curious, I’ve never seen birds like 
                         these.

                         What’s this all about?

                         What are we going to do? There must 
                         be a thousand keys up there!

                         What’s wrong Harry?

                         I don’t like this. I don’t like this 
                         at all.

                         Now what do we do?

                         What happens now?

                         Ron you don’t suppose this’ll be like 
                         real wizard’s chess do you?

                         What is it?

                         No you can’t! There must be another 
                         way!

                         You’ll be okay Harry. You’re a great 
                         wizard. You really are.

                         Me? Books, cleverness. There are more 
                         important things. Friendship and bravery. 
                         And Harry, just be careful.

                         Never better.

                         We're tied with Slytherin!

                         Come on Harry.

                         Feels strange to be going home doesn't 
                         it?
