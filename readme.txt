Checkpoint 3 - Main Algorithm

Currently the project can find the tf-idf similarities between the parsed scripts and a user's public twitter feed. It has not yet been incorporated with the UI, and will be receiving some tweaks and further testing before the in class demos.

To Run: 

Simply run the file TFIDF.py in a folder that also contains tweetcollector.py and the following text files: draco_lines.txt, dumbledore_lines.txt, hagrid_lines.txt, harry_lines.txt, hermione_lines.txt, ron_lines.txt

you must have the following packages installed on your machine: NLTK, PyYAML

You can change the twitter user by modifying the variable twitter_user on line 35 of TFIDFscore.py

We are still looking into incorporating the natural processing language (npl) extension to our tweet analyzing function.
